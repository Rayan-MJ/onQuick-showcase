## Project Summary 📜

This project is a **mobile app** developed using **Flutter**, integrated with **Google Firebase** for backend services and **Stripe** as the payment gateway.  
It addresses the problem of **cart abandonment in e-commerce** by providing:

- A **fast checkout solution** to reduce friction during purchase.  
- A **Shopping Info Vault** to securely store payment information, ensuring quick and seamless transactions for users.  

## Project Overview 📄
 
Cart abandonment is a significant issue in e-commerce businesses, 
with studies showing that nearly 70% of shopping carts are 
abandoned before checkout. This not only results in significant lost 
revenue but also highlights inefficiencies in the online shopping 
process. To address the issue of cart abandonment, we propose 
developing a system that includes a fast checkout solution and a 
Shopping Info Vault to store all payment information.
